# LayoutGen

layoutgen is pure Python to create something that resembles the French BMD documents (handwritten header, paragraphs, margins). Layout only is demonstrated in `example_layoutgen.py`.

layoutgen can also populate a layout with text and create the corresponding OCR data. This is demonstrated `french_bmd_from_layoutgen.py`.
